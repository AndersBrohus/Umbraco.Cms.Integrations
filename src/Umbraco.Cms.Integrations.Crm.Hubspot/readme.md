# Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot

This integration provides a form picker and rendering component for forms managed within a [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) account.

## Prerequisites

Requires minimum version of Umbraco CMS: 8.5.4.

## How To Use

### Authentication

The package supports two modes of authentication:

- API Key
- OAuth

#### API Key

Log into your HubSpot account, go to _Settings > Integrations > API Key_ and create an API key.

Add this to an app setting in `Web.config`:

```
  <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot.DefaultLanguage" value="[your API key]" />
    ...
  </appSettings>
```

#### OAuth

TBC.

### Backoffice usage

TBC.

### Front-end rendering

A strongly typed model will be generated by the property value converter, and an HTML helper is available, to easily render the form on the front-end.

Ensure your template has a reference to the following using statement:

```
@using Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot.Helpers;
```

And render the form using (assuming a property based on the created data type, with alias `hubSpotForm` has been created):

```
@Html.RenderHubspotForm(Model.HubspotForm)
```
