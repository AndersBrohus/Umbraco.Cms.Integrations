# Algolia
This integration lets you index the content of your Umbraco webpage to optimize search operations!

This integration with Algolia allows you to manage, build, search, and delete an index from your Umbraco backoffice. Searching for an index can also be done from Algolia Dashboard. 

The current integration provides a custom dashboard called _Algolia Search Management_, available in the _Settings_ section of the backoffice, where editors can define the content schema they want to be indexed and push the data payload to Algolia.

**Want to know more about how the integration is made?**

If you want to see the details on how the integration to Algolia is made or just follow the example of extending Umbraco with a third-party system you can take a look at the [blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/integrating-umbraco-cms-with-algolia/) supplementing this integration.
