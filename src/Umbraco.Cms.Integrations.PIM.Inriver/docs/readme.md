# inriver

This integration gives you access to your inriver products from your Umbraco backoffice and allows you to select products to be published on your Umbraco webpage!

With the integration, you get a  custom product picker that can be used as a property editor for content, a value converter providing a strongly typed model for rendering, and a sample rendering component for the selected product.

Specifically, you can select the inriver property editor on a data type. In the inriver property editor configuration, select your inriver entity types and pick the information from your inriver Control Center you want to be displayed. Add your property editor to the content type and you are all set to search for and pick products from inriver to be displayed on your Umbraco website.
