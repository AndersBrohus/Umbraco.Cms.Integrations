# Aprimo
This integration to Aprimo provides a tool for selecting digital assets from an Aprimo workspace into your Umbraco backoffice and publishing them to your Umbraco webpage! 

The provided tool is a Property Editor called Apriom Media Picker. The picker can be configured to search and select assets in two ways. Using the  Aprimo REST API allows assets to be retrieved by using a Umbraco interface where you can search assets by title. Using the Aprimo Content Selector assets are retrieved using a rich Aprimo user interface and allows you to use the advanced filtering options from Aprimo. Note that the Aprimo Content Selector is only available with the supported browsers. 

A rendering component is available for displaying the selected assets using a strongly-typed model generated by the property value converter. The components support you in working with your media files to fit perfectly into the content on your Umbraco webpage.
