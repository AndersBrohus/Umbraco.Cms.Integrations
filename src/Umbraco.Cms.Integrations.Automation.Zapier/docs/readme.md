# Zapier with CMS
With the Umbraco App in the Zapier App Directory you can connect Umbraco with 5.000+ systems and define endless automated workflows for when content is published to your Umbraco webpage!  

More in detail the Umbraco App allows you to access your Umbraco content types when logged into Zapier and subscribe to this content type. You then connect to a system and create an action to happen when your content is published. Based on the content type alias a mock-up object with the matching properties will get displayed in the Zapier interface. The properties will be available for embedding into the action steps you will define. 

When the automatic workflow is activated (content gets published) the subscription hook will be saved into the database and will be viewable in the Zapier Integrations backoffice dashboard.
